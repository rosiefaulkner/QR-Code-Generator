# QR Code Generator Using React

The idea behind creating a quick response (QR) code generator is to translate data from images to text. A QR code is simply the representation of image data as text, and it has a lot of useful applications from restaurant menus and concert tickets, to online calendar invites, payments, and the list goes on.  

The option for users to download the generated QR code makes it useful in a wide variety of use cases. From printing the code to embedding it on a website, the use cases are unlimited.
